# Business Recommendations

## 1. Prioritize High-Risk Customers

Focus monitoring and controls on customers with:
- High chargeback rates
- Recent high-value activity

This yields better ROI than blanket rules.

---

## 2. Introduce Tiered Controls

Examples:
- Step-up verification for high-risk customers
- Transaction limits based on risk tier
- Manual review only where risk justifies cost

---

## 3. Monitor Leading Indicators

Track failure rates and behavior changes before:
- Chargebacks occur
- Loss is realized

Early intervention is cheaper than remediation.

---

## 4. Use This as a Foundation

This framework can be extended with:
- Time decay
- Weighted scoring
- Machine learning models

But even in its current form, it is actionable and explainable.
