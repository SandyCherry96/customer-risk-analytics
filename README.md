# 📊 Customer Risk Analysis — SQL Project

## 1. Business Problem & Objective

### Business Problem
The company processes a large volume of customer transactions, but some customers create financial and operational risk through fraud attempts, payment failures, and chargebacks. These risky behaviors can lead to revenue loss, increased operational costs, regulatory issues, and damage to customer trust.

Currently, risk-related information is scattered across multiple tables (transactions, payments, fraud flags, and chargebacks), making it difficult to identify risky customers early and consistently.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to use SQL to:

- Consolidate multiple risk signals into a single, unified **customer-level view**
- Identify **high-risk customers** based on historical behavior
- Create a **risk scoring and segmentation framework** (Low / Medium / High)
- Enable **data-driven decisions** such as customer monitoring, policy tightening, or preventive actions
- Produce **dashboard-ready tables** that can be directly consumed by **Power BI**

---

## Key Business Questions Addressed

- Which customers are generating the highest risk?
- What type of risk is most common (fraud, payment failure, chargeback)?
- Are high-risk customers still profitable?
- How does customer risk change over time?
- Which customers should be monitored, restricted, or reviewed?

---

## Success Criteria

- A clear **customer-level risk score**
- Actionable **risk segmentation**
- Clean, validated **SQL outputs ready for visualization**
- Insights that support **operational and risk-management decisions**
